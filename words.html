                <p>I pitched, reported and wrote this story on the rich community surrounding the College Park parkrun, a weekly 5k in the city surrounding my university. This is my favorite piece I've ever written. </p>

                <p>Even before I learned how to code, I was writing data-driven stories. I pitched, wrote and did the data analysis for this story on the exorbitant housing prices around campus — and why they're unlikely to go down. </p>

                <p>I pitched and wrote this story on a new preschool opening in College Park, an area long notorious for its scant childcare and early education options.</p>

                <p>I did the data analysis that led to key findings in this story about how U.S. oversight of worker safety during the pandemic splintered between agencies, leaving workers vulnerable. The project, collaboratively produced by the Howard Center, was published in AP and other outlets.
