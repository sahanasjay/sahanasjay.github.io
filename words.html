                <p> I collected, cleaned, joined and analyzed traffic fatalities data from multiple agencies. Using that data, I created choropleth maps and ran spatial joins in R to generate and visualize the findings that drove this story — findings that told us lower-income communities bore the geographic brunt of the deaths, and that most of the victims were Black. I spent time talking to residents of some of the most heavily impacted neighborhoods about their experiences, grounding the piece in their stories. </p>

                <p> I fact-checked and analyzed grocery store and pharmacy records for this story, generating the data underlying the map and finding that Buffalo's majority-White areas have 22 percent more pharmacies than its majority-Black areas. </p>
